# Space-SHMUP
Part 1 -

I increased hero speed
I increased the gravity and sensitivity of the vertical and horizontal axes in the Input Manager
I changed the spread weapon to shoot 5 projectiles and increased delayBetweenShots
I increased the speed of the blaster fire and had it do less damage
(much of this was changed again in part 2)

Part 2 - 

I added a home screen to navigate through levels 
I added a player current score and a lives GUI element 
	The game returns to th emain menu when the lives are over 
I added a highscore that saves and is included while playing as well as on teh home screen 
I added 3 difficulty settings (Easy, Intermediate and Expert)
	For each level I edited Hero speed, types of enemies, amount of enemies, hit damage to enemies and more 
	accoriding to difficulty
